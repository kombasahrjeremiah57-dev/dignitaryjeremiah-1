             chorous
                Come swell the chorus one and all and join the ranks with me;<br>
        First Stanza
Prosperity to the Prince’s boys upstanding three times three.<br>
Dear as of old and dear as now and despite any storm<br>
Long live for many a thousand years our Prince of Wales, Kingtom <br>
Prince of Wales Centenary Committee<br>
     
For searching Sierra Leone far and wide,<br>
no school can well be found;<br>
That sends forth truer gentlemen,<br>
or stands on firmer ground <br>

’Tis not alone in science lore her manly sons excel;<br>
The cricket and the athletic grounds their tale of triumph tell.<br>
The Church, the State, the Camp and Bar, with varied voice attest,<br>
That where so’er bright honour calls, her sons are with the best. <br>
Prince of Wales Centenary Committee <br>

As on her walls we read the names renowned in former days,<br>
With beating hearts we vow to match their daring and their praise;<br>
For who would care through time to drift with dull and drowsy face<br>
Prince of Wales Centenary Committee<br>

Though scattered far we seldom meet the friends our boyhood knew,<br>
Old joys and griefs in memory dwell, toned down to sober hue,<br>
And as some well remembered name grows great, we glow with pride,<br>
To think that in our youthful days, we struggled at his side. <br>
Prince of Wales Centenary Committee <br>

And when at last old age is ours and manhood’s strength has fled,<br>
And young ambition’s fire is cold and earthly hopes lie dead;<br>
We feel our boyhood’s thrill once more and think it’s just life’s morn,<br>
And keep a niche within our hearts for Prince of Wales, Kingtom. <br>
